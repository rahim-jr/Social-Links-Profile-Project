## Overview
This project involved creating a responsive social links profile page. The goal was to implement a clean and accessible design that works seamlessly across different devices. The challenge focused on practicing modern web development techniques, including semantic HTML, CSS for layout and styling, and ensuring interactive elements have proper hover and focus states.

The design required attention to detail, particularly in replicating the provided layout and ensuring the user experience is intuitive. By completing this project, I gained hands-on experience with responsive design principles and improved my ability to create visually appealing and functional web pages.

### The challenge
The challenge was to build out a social links profile page and ensure it looks as close to the provided design as possible. Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the page using a keyboard for accessibility
- Ensure the design is responsive and visually appealing across different screen sizes
- Implement semantic HTML and clean, maintainable CSS
- Optionally, add animations or transitions to enhance the user experience

## My process

To complete this project, I followed a structured approach:

1. **Planning and Setup**:  
    I started by carefully analyzing the design and requirements provided in the challenge. I set up the project structure, including the necessary folders for assets, styles, and components.

2. **HTML Markup**:  
    I wrote semantic HTML to ensure the structure of the page was accessible and easy to understand. I used appropriate tags for headings, lists, and links to maintain a logical document flow.

3. **Styling with CSS**:  
    I implemented a mobile-first workflow, starting with styles for smaller screens and progressively enhancing the design for larger viewports. I used CSS custom properties for consistent theming and utilized Flexbox and Grid for layout management.

4. **Interactivity and Accessibility**:  
    I added hover and focus states to all interactive elements to improve the user experience. I also ensured the page was fully navigable via keyboard and adhered to accessibility best practices.

5. **Testing and Debugging**:  
    I tested the design across multiple devices and browsers to ensure responsiveness and compatibility. I used browser developer tools to debug and refine the layout and styles.

6. **Final Touches**:  
    I optimized the code for readability and maintainability. I also added animations to enhance the user experience, ensuring they were subtle and non-intrusive.

This process helped me stay organized and efficiently complete the project while adhering to best practices in web development.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of several key web development concepts:

1. **Responsive Design**:  
    I improved my ability to create layouts that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes using a mobile-first approach. This involved leveraging CSS Grid and Flexbox to build flexible and scalable designs.

2. **Semantic HTML**:  
    Writing semantic HTML helped me structure the content in a way that is both accessible and meaningful. This practice not only improves accessibility but also enhances the maintainability of the code.

3. **CSS Custom Properties**:  
    I learned how to use CSS custom properties effectively to maintain consistent theming throughout the project. This made it easier to manage and update styles.

4. **Accessibility Best Practices**:  
    Ensuring that all interactive elements had proper hover and focus states taught me the importance of accessibility. I also learned how to make the page fully navigable via keyboard.

5. **Testing and Debugging**:  
    Testing the project across different devices and browsers helped me identify and fix layout inconsistencies. This experience reinforced the importance of thorough testing in delivering a polished product.

6. **Subtle Animations**:  
    Adding animations to enhance the user experience taught me how to strike a balance between functionality and aesthetics. I focused on keeping animations subtle and non-distracting.

Overall, this project was a valuable opportunity to practice and refine my front-end development skills while adhering to modern web standards.
